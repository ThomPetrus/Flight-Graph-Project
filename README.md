# Flight-Graph-Project

Install the required packages and run the `algorithmOneTest.py` or `algorithmTwoTest.py` scripts.
If you run into any errors, you may have to re-run the jupyter notebook called `processdataSetsMultiFlight.ipynb` 
in order to re-process the datasets used in the creation of the graph.

Finds an optimal path using a Dijkstra's based approach. Optimal path is defined as one with the minimal weighted sum of the flight cost, flight duration and any wait time incurred at an airport. Implemented in python using the Networkx library and a multi directed graph. Where nodes are aiports and flights are edges.

All data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
